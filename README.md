# Video-based Cross-modal Auxiliary Network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis
The video-based cross-modal auxiliary network (VCAN) consists of two components: the Audio Feature Map Module (AFMM), which enhances multi-scale acoustic sentiment representation; and the Cross-Modal Selection Module (CMSM), which aims to improve the interactivity of audiovisual modalities and eliminate redundant computations.

## Gettinf Started
These instructions will providee you with a core copy of the VCAN. you can adapt it and run on your local machine for development and testing purposes. This model runs on a Windows system using the PyCharm Community Edition. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Test demo
The encrypted code available for testing can be downloaded.
You can use this [https URL](https://cloud.189.cn/t/uaeeiavmuQ3u)（访问码：n3n7) or [pCloud URL](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZQr58VZRzrGxsst1yJoCA8WoKEs3SXMLoU7) to download the algorithm demo.   

Updated on 6, June, 2022: a function script was added.

Updated on 16, July, 2022: scripts related to fast guided filter algorithm were added.

## Images displayed in paper

20 images displayed in the paper can be downloaded at this [https URL](https://cloud.189.cn/web/share?code=qymAJzayuei2)（访问码：mgj4）or [pCloud URL](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZCNfHVZ4MYNMM5C8Buy29FaHGdDJh6tSYzV) (size = 13.51MB). 


## Modified version of HDR dataset

250 pairs of images in HDR dataset can be downloaded at this [https URL](https://cloud.189.cn/web/share?code=NZ7ZZbjeuAVz) or [pCloud URL](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZ2NfHVZChgPglepTRLgNkuMHbULgB9Ja2bV) (size = 352MB).

The zip file contains two folders, the 'lowlight' folder and the 'Refimg' folder.

'lowlight' folder contains 250 images under low light.

'Refimg' folder contains 250 images under normal light.

Note: 

1.Please do not change the serial number of the images. They correspond to each other. e.g.  'HDRR(1).PNG' is the reference image under normal illumination of 'HDRL(1).PNG'.

2.Please [click this address](https://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/HDRDB/hdr_index.html) to see more about the original HDR dataset.
